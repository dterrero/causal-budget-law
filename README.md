## üß© Overview

The **Causal Budget Law** expresses the conservation of total causal capacity:

$c^{2} = v_{\text{ext}}^{2} + v_{\text{int}}^{2}$ ,

linking external motion and internal transformation under a finite causal rate $c$.  
All relativistic and quantum behaviors emerge from this single invariant partition ‚Äî **without invoking spacetime geometry**.

This repository unifies all theoretical, computational, and numerical work derived from that principle, including:
- The emergence of time as energy overcoming resistance,
- Gravitational light bending and strong-field optics,
- Atomic timekeeping (Cs-133 clock),
- Future extensions into perihelion precession, quantum fields, and causal quantization.

## üìö Core Works

| Document | Focus | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Proper Time as Emergent from Energy and Opposition** | Foundations | Derives proper time as $\tau = E/P$ and introduces the transformation law $\mathcal{T} = Ec/P$, with calibrated opposition $F_{\text{cal}} = P/c$. |
| **Causal Light-Bending from the Causal-Budget Law** | Gravitation | Derives gravitational deflection $\delta = 4GM/(c^{2}b$ and strong-field photon-sphere behavior directly from causal suppression. |
| **Derivation of the Cs-133 Clock from the Causal-Budget Law** | Quantum / Atomic | Shows that the SI-second hyperfine frequency arises from causal energy‚Äìresistance dynamics, matching experiment within 1%. |

## üß† Theoretical Scope

Every relation in this framework follows the **universal transformation law**:

## üî¨ Research Goals

1. **Operational Foundations** ‚Äì express every measurable relation through energy and power rather than geometry.  
2. **Empirical Consistency** ‚Äì reproduce all tested predictions of relativity and QED.  
3. **Unified Quantization** ‚Äì derive quantum mechanics and gravity from causal energy flow.  
4. **Predictive Departures** ‚Äì identify regimes (strong-field, ultra-fast, or quantum-coherent) where measurable deviations may appear.

## üß≠ Vision

The long-term objective is to establish the **Causal Budget Law** as the foundational bridge between relativity, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics ‚Äî showing that *geometry is an emergent bookkeeping of causal energy flow.*

Every addition to this repository extends that bridge ‚Äî from planetary motion to quantum gravity.
